        This article includes both an objective introduction of websites and subjective metaphors to help readers better understand what a website should be like. I really appreciate the metaphor of "website as a garden" because it uses the changes of seasons to remind me of the different layout designs of a single website, and the products from each season can refer to the various elements designers utilize in a website. I love this metaphor because it gives me a sense of rich, vibrant colors.
My website will be a river. When visitors follow the river, they may see the scenery along the way: flowers, squirrels hiding behind stones, an oak tree covered in acorns… As they move downstream, the website updates—because time itself is also a river. It may pass through other towns, landscapes, and rivers, creating connections with other websites.
Since I enjoy rich and varied experiences, my website would focus more on the combinations of elements and the interactive experience, such as the use of multimedia.
