        I appreciate the “Turing-esque test” offered by Elan, as it provides a clear standard to pursue. To be more specific, instead of proving what people can do more than AI, the rubric emphasizes what makes us distinctly human. It is exactly these human qualities that allow us to express ourselves. The most inspiring standard is considering the audience. It reminds me of the game design principle I have read, which is to make all your design — mechanism, technology, story, and aesthetics — target one theme and your audience. This is an art of simplification. For instance, British designer Rich Gold discusses a simple example of “less is more”. If a book’s aim is to tell children what an elephant is, all elements are designed to reinforce this theme. A wide variety of texts and images about elephants, as well as the elephant-shaped cover and interior pages, are used to help kids understand elephants.
From the viewpoints of the audience and customers, targeting a specific audience and maintaining a personal style could build a personal brand identity and provide people with what they desire. However, I initially thought this might contradict what Elan says in this reading: Elan says that Vivian Gornick “knew who was speaking” and “why she was speaking”. To me, trying to create based on the most genuine intentions in my heart might be difficult to maintain consistency in style or completely considering the needs of the audience. Conveying my message and making the audience accept are like two somewhat opposing needs that required a balance. Yet perhaps Elan’s idea shows these are not so opposing, because knowing ourselves deeply can help us connect more genuinely with our audience.
To sum up, I think the main inspiration this article gives me is to think deeply before creating, and imperfection is always part of humanity and originality. Besides, intentionality (who I am, who I speak to, and why I speak) is key to expressiveness.
