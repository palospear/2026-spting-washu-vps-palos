        The discussion provides two categories: cyborgs and rooms, which assist me in realizing the potential interactions with human beings and technologies. Since human cognition depends on external devices, such as language and signs, it is natural for human beings to develop as cyborgs. The use of magnetic implants, multimodal interaction using both voice and gesture, and the use of Project Cybersyn, which was used for economic decision-making, are examples of this concept. The most inspiring part for me is the use of interactive elements, which reminds me that the most important concept of a UI/UX system is the experience of the users. The interaction is the combination of the modalities, which is influenced by the environment and the movement of the individual. It also reminds me of the profile card task, in which we could add a link for our personal song list to express ourselves. In addition, as a video fan, the discussion on rooms and multimodal conversational computing reminds me of the video on the use of the computer for communication.
